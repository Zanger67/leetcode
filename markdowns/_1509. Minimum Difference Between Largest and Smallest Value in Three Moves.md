Since we have exactly 3 moves, we only have 4 cases to worry about.

First things first. If we have an array of length 4 or less, we can just set the values to be equal and have a difference of 0.

In most cases however, we will be comparing the 4 max values and 4 min values. By setting any extrema to a value of our choosing, we can set it to the average number, negating it all together. If we have $s1, s2, s3, s4, l4, l3, l2, l1,$ represent the smallest 4 and largest 4 values in the array, we know our result will be the min of: $min(l4-s1, l3-s2, l2-s3, l1-s4)$. 

The simplest approach is to sort and check these 4 values ($O(n\log{n})$).

Alternatively, we can do a single pass of the entire array to find the max 4 and min 4 values in linear time ($O(n)$). Even though in my case I used `sort()` to rearrange the values, since it's a single pass of in effect insertion sort on a array of max length 4, it remains linear.

### Python
#### [m1509 v1 Daily Sorting.py](<../my-submissions/m1509 v1 Daily Sorting.py>)
```Python
class Solution:
    def minDifference(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(nums) <= 4 :
            return 0
        nums.sort()

        return min(nums[-1] - nums[3], 
                   nums[-2] - nums[2], 
                   nums[-3] - nums[1], 
                   nums[-4] - nums[0])
```

#### [m1509 v2 Daily Single Pass No Sort.py](<../my-submissions/m1509 v2 Daily Single Pass No Sort.py>)
```Python
# .sort() for 4 values would be minimal and a constant max 
# cost. This just simplified the typing process but could easily
# be changed for better efficiency. It's essentially a single 
# iteration of insertion sort.

class Solution:
    def minDifference(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(nums) <= 4 :
            return 0
        
        top4 = sorted(nums[:4], reverse=True)
        bot4 = sorted(nums[:4])

        for num in nums[4:] :
            if num > top4[3] :
                top4.append(num)
                top4.sort(reverse=True)
                top4.pop()
            if num < bot4[3] :
                bot4.append(num)
                bot4.sort()
                bot4.pop()

        return min([top4[i] - bot4[3 - i] for i in range(4)])

```
