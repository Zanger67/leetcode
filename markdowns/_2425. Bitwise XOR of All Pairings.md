> Logic:
> 
> Take arrays A and B. If B is of even length, then each element of A will
> be XORed into the total of an even number of times, negating itself. This
> applies to all values in the array. Thus we can skip it if B is even length.
> 
> The same applies vise versa.
> 
> Besides that, an odd number of times no matter how many will be just like
> if there was only 1 XOR for that value since all others would negate it.
> This is clear when you look at the definition of an odd integer: $x=2y+1$
> where $x$ is your odd value and $y$ is an integer.

### Python
#### [m2425.py](<../my-submissions/m2425.py>)
```Python
class Solution:
    def xorAllNums(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> int:
        return (reduce(xor, nums1) if len(nums2) % 2 else 0) ^ (reduce(xor, nums2) if len(nums1) % 2 else 0)

```
