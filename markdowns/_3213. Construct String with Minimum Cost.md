> Did the contest live and got through Q1 & Q2 very quickly. When I saw Q3 however, 
> I got really confused so I decided to just skip it for now. Somehow, I was able to get 
> Q4 then when I got back to Q3, I realized what the solution was and laid out the steps, 
> but didn't have enough time to implement it. So yeah... good contest lol. First time 
> getting 3 questions too funny enough lol.

> #### Version 1
> 
> Did a `DP` + `String Comparison` to get my solution. If this TLEed or MLEed, I would have 
> changed to a `DP` + `Trie` solution to optimize the `word == target[i:i+len(word)]` portion. 
> This, however, was unnecessary to pass the contest test cases, and so I moved onto 
> another question as the contest was still active.
> 
> I do want to come back to this question and try the Ahoâ€“Corasick + DP solution.

> #### Version 2
> 
> Tried adjusting for a `DP` + `Trie` solution and was successful. Overall time savings 
> brought runtimes down from an average of `12300ms` down to `11700ms`, though only 
> after additional tinkering. Next step, Aho-Corasick!

> From Reddit:

> ```
> The correct solution involves realizing that in if 
> sum(len(w) for w in words) = M, then then are O(sqrt(M)) 
> unique word lengths. Couple this with string hashing and 
> you have an O(N * sqrt(M)) algorithm. 
> 
> ...
> 
> Consider all the unique lengths as a list of length n. A 
> lower bound of this is [1, 2, ..., n] with a total length 
> of n(n+1)/2. Solving n(n+1)/2 = m gives n = O(sqrt(m)) 
> ```
> 
> Also, look into the potential for rolling hash solutions.
