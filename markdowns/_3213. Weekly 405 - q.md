### Python
#### [h3213 q4.py](<../my-submissions/Weekly 405/h3213 q4.py>)
```Python
class Solution:
    def minimumCost(self, target: str, words: List[str], costs: List[int]) -> int:
        wordToCost = Counter()
        for w, c in zip(words, costs) :
            # Always take the lowest cost case
            if w in wordToCost and wordToCost[w] <= c :
                continue
            wordToCost[w] = c

        # Remove duplicates from being checked
        words = sorted(set(words), key=lambda x: len(x))
        maxWrd = len(words) - 1

        dp = [0] + [inf] * len(target)

        for i in range(len(target)) :
            while maxWrd >= 0 and len(words[maxWrd]) > len(target) - i :
                maxWrd -= 1
            if maxWrd < 0 :
                break

            for word in words[:maxWrd + 1] :
                if word == target[i:i+len(word)] :
                    dp[i + len(word)] = min(dp[i + len(word)], dp[i] + wordToCost[word])

        return -1 if dp[-1] == inf else dp[-1]

Did the contest live and got through Q1 & Q2 very quickly. When I saw Q3 however, 
I got really confused so I decided to just skip it for now. Somehow, I was able to get 
Q4 then when I got back to Q3, I realized what the solution was and laid out the steps, 
but didn't have enough time to implement it. So yeah... good contest lol. First time 
getting 3 questions too funny enough lol.
