### Python
#### [e1184.py](<../my-submissions/e1184.py>)
```Python
class Solution:
    def distanceBetweenBusStops(self, distance: List[int], start: int, destination: int) -> int:
        counter, clockwise = start, start
        counterDist, clockwiseDist = 0, 0

        while not counter == destination and not clockwise == destination :
            counter = (counter - 1 + len(distance)) % len(distance)
            counterDist += distance[counter]

            clockwiseDist += distance[clockwise]
            clockwise = (clockwise + 1) % len(distance)

        if (clockwise == destination) :
            while not counter == destination and counterDist < clockwiseDist :
                counter = (counter - 1 + len(distance)) % len(distance)
                counterDist += distance[counter]

            if counter == destination and counterDist < clockwiseDist :
                return counterDist
            return clockwiseDist

        while not clockwise == destination and clockwiseDist < counterDist :
            clockwiseDist += distance[clockwise]
            clockwise = (clockwise + 1) % len(distance)

        if clockwise == destination and clockwiseDist < counterDist:
            return clockwiseDist
        return counterDist
