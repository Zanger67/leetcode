> #### Notes
> Discount total = total cost - (top DISCOUNT costs / 2)
> 
> #### Version 1
> First attempt was extremly inefficient due to the constant 
> parsing of next nodes and the potential for $n*discounts$ number of 
> heap values. I think a large part was actually due to my attempt to 
> make it *more* efficient by checking the existing cases if there are 
> less discounts remaining lol.
> 
> Took upwards of 7000ms but did in fact pass the test cases.
> 
> 
> 
> #### Version 2
> Changed to a $n\times n$ matrix to parse data instead which proved 
> much more efficient sitting around 1700ms compared to the previous.
> 
> 
> #### Version 3
> Updated it since we're performing a Dijstra's algo based on a heap, 
> the first time we reach the node will with certainty be the shortest path.
> 
> This brougth it down further to just around 420ms.
> 
> 
> #### Version 4
> Swapped out the $n\times n$ matrix for a list of $n$ dicts but it didn't have any 
> notable benefitial difference compared to version 3. However, depending on the number 
> of discounts (if much greater) and a much larger network of cities, this may be better 
> in that larger scale.
> 
> With the current test cases, it hovers at around 480ms.
