```Python
# Definition for singly-linked list.

    def rotateRight(self, head: Optional[ListNode], k: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if not head :
            return None

        # Since worst case 500 nodes but  k can be much larger
        curr = head

        while curr :
            listLength += 1
