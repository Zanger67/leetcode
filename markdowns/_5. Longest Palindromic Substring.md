> ***Version 1*** is severly inefficient since it checks each pair of indicies, reasulting in at 
> least $O(n^2)$ runtime. On top of that, the inside of the nested loop has another for loop 
> to check whether the substring is a palindrome. This would make the runtime increase further 
> to a worst case leaning towards $O(n^3)$. While it does avoid redundant cases (i.e.) substrings 
> of a length that wouldn't improve the current record, it's still a major negative.

> ***Version 2*** on the other hand avoids this by starting from the centre of each potential palindrome. 
> It iterates through the string twice, once where it assumes the centre is a single character (and thus at 
> least a palindrome of length $n$) and again where the indices $i$ and $i+1$ are used as the centre. In effect, 
> it's checking odd and even length palindromes. This ends up being comfortably $O(n^2)$; a much greater improvement 
> as compared to *Version 1*.
