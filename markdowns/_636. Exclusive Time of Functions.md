> Found that one of the test cases was invalid and submitted it when I originally solved this question since it was preventing my code from working. 
> This was verified by LeetCode in their feedback and now passes, so I've uploaded the code I originally had as the removal allows it to pass now.

> Test case 121/123
> 
> `n=3`
> 
> `logs = ["1:start:0","0:start:2","1:start:3","2:start:4","2:end:4","0:end:6","1:end:7","1:end:8"]`)
> 
> has an expected output `[2, 6, 1]` which I believe to be invalid. Going through it by hand I believe it should be `[1, 7, 1]`
> 
> If I am mistaken then I do apologize for the confusion / inconvenience.
> 
> Two possible reasons:
> 1. `0:end:6` is invalid based on the question description since it's not the current active process
> 2. Assuming that we can cancel/end non-actives, the summed exclusive runtime of Process-0 at the time of cancellation is 1, meaning it cannot have an expected answer of 2. See below for the step-by-step.

>  `["1:start:0","0:start:2","1:start:3","2:start:4","2:end:4","0:end:6","1:end:7","1:end:8"]`
> 
> With this, we can construct a table of `[0-8]` to fill.

> `0:end:6` occurs and halts that process but since it's not active, it has no effect.
