>     - contains origin val
>     - Cannot have 1x1 submatrix cause at least one X and equal XY
> 
>     Start on X spots and expand?
>     Match X with nearest Y above, below, left, right?
> 
>     Weird prefix sum x2? Count by row and col, then also do a cumulative one to 
>     get the instantaneous difference?
> 
>     Wait si this a area based prefix sum where you take a corner's full sum, add 
>     the other corner, and remove the sides due to the overlap?

>     I'm dumb lol. I interpretted the "contains grid[0][0]" as inside the box from (x1, y1) 
>     to (x2, y2) inclusive, there must be at least one value equal to the value found at 
>     grid[0][0].

>     I realized after that it meant that each submatrix MUST START at (0, 0), simplifying 
>     the question HEAVILY.
