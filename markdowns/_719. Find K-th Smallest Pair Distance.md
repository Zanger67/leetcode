> I originally tried brute forcing which didn't work. 
> Then I tried bucketsorting with the number of digits of each 
> difference, which resulted in a TLE of 17/19 passed (the same 
> as brute force). I think this mainly due to the log 
> operations being slow, though it's unconfirmed.

### Python
#### [h719 counting bucketsort.py](<../my-submissions/h719 counting bucketsort.py>)
```Python
class Solution:
    def smallestDistancePair(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        buckets = [0 for _ in range(max(nums) + 1)]

        for i, v in enumerate(nums[:-1]) :
            for u in nums[i + 1:] :
                buckets[abs(u - v)] += 1

        indx = 0
        while k > buckets[indx] :
            k -= buckets[indx]
            indx += 1
        return indx
