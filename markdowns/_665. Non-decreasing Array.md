> Idea
>     Go through each adjacent pairing until you find an increasing pairing
>     
>     If found, check to see if it's the last value causing the decrease.
>         Return True if it is cause we can just change to be infinity or starmap
>         
>         Iterate through the values to the right of the issue section to see if
>         there's another issue. If there is, return False cause we're only alowed
>         to modify one value.
> 
>         Return True if the problem value is the first pairing, since we can just
>         nums[0] = -inf to solve it
> 
>         Return True if by deleting the value or by deleting the value before, the 
>         two halves connect and are non-decreasing.
> 
>         It's an OR cause it could be smt like [1, 2, 5, 7, 3, 5, 6] where (7, 3) is
>         the flagged pair but (5, 3) by deleting 7 doesn't work and (7, 5) by deleting
>         3 also doesn't work
> 
>     If no increasing pair found at all, return true

### Java
#### [m665.java](<../my-submissions/m665.java>)
```Java
class Solution {
    public boolean checkPossibility(int[] nums) {
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (!(nums[i - 1] > nums[i])) {
                continue;
            }

            if (i + 1 >= nums.length) {
                return true;
            }

            for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
                if (nums[j - 1] > nums[j]) {
                    return false;
                }
            }

            if (i == 1) {
                return true;
            }

            return (nums[i - 2] <= nums[i]) || (nums[i - 1] <= nums[i + 1]);
        }

        return true;
    }
}
```

### Python
#### [m665.py](<../my-submissions/m665.py>)
```Python
class Solution:
    def checkPossibility(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        for i in range(1, len(nums)) :
            if nums[i - 1] > nums[i] :
                # is last val causing so we don't have to "reconnect"
                if i + 1 >= len(nums) :
                    return True

                # if right half has issue, we have more than 1 edit confirmed
                for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)) :
                    if nums[j - 1] > nums[j] :
                        return False
                
                # if issue is the starting value, we don't have to check the two sides
                if i == 1 :
                    return True

                # if deleting one of the two values will allow the two halves to connect
                # so that they're non-decending, we good
                return (nums[i - 2] <= nums[i]) or (nums[i - 1] <= nums[i + 1])

        # by default already non-decending
        return True
```
