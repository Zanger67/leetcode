>     We can just go right to left. 
>     - If rightmost bit is 0, +1 step and shift position left 1
>     - If 1, +1 step and have a "carry" for the next

        carry = False
        position = len(s) - 1

        while position > 0 :
            if s[position] == '0' and not carry :
                counter += 1
