> #### Notes
> 
> ```
> if you have X _ _ _ X where X=sick and _=not sick, how many ways?
> 
> We can count the gaps then multiple the number of ways each gap can do it
> 1 person --> 1
> 2 ppl --> 2
> 3 ppl --> 4
> X__ XX_ XXX
> X__ X_X XXX
> __X _XX XXX
> __X X_X XXX

> Cause we have left and right as a choice each time till the last where they merge

> Let n=size of gap

> # Ways = 2^(n-1)

> 
> The leftmost group and rightmost group only have 1 way since they're

> Edge cases (literally):
> X _ _ _ _   only 1 way
> _ X _       2 ways
> _ _ X       1 way
> _ X _ _     3 ways
> 
> _ _ X _ _   6 ways
> Right-Left side is 4 choose 2?

> m+n choose m? it's a binary string method

> FINAL FORMULA: 
> Product of:
> 2^(g - 1) for each group surrounded by 2 sick individuals
> (L + R) choose (L) where L and R are the number of not sick people on the edges
> (n!)(a!b!c!...z!) where n=the total number of not sick indivudals 
>                     and a,b,c...= the size of each not sick group

```Python
# NOTE: Literally on the edge of runtimes lol
# Passes runtime ~50% of the time, other half it barely fails

class Solution:
    def numberOfSequence(self, n: int, sick: List[int]) -> int:
        minn, maxx = sick[0], sick[-1]

        totalToInfect = 0
        groupSizes = [(0, 0)]
        output = 1

        if minn > 0 :
            totalToInfect += minn
            groupSizes.append((minn, minn))
        if n - maxx - 1 > 0 :
            count = n - maxx - 1
            totalToInfect += count
            groupSizes.append((count, count + groupSizes[-1][1]))

        for i in range(1, len(sick)) :
            numPeople = sick[i] - sick[i - 1] - 1
            if numPeople > 0 :
                totalToInfect += numPeople
                groupSizes.append((numPeople, numPeople + groupSizes[-1][1]))
                output *= 2 ** (numPeople - 1)

        def multinomial(groups: List[Tuple[int, int]]):
            modd = 10 ** 9 + 7
            return math.prod(math.comb(x[1], x[0]) % (modd) for x in groups)

        return (output * multinomial(groupSizes[1:])) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
