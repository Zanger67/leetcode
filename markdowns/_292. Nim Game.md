''' Notes
    1 - true
    2 - true
    3 - true
    4 - false
    5 - true    -1, any, -3
    6 - true    -2, any, -3
    7 - true    -3, any, -3 
    8 - false 

    As long as you're not a multiple of 4, you can force the other
    into becoming the multiple of 4, thus winning it for yourself.

    Basically just intuitive proof by mathematical induction.

class Solution:
    def canWinNim(self, n: int) -> bool:
        return not 0 == n % 4
