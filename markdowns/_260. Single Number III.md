''' Thought process
    Since we're finding the cases where they only appear once,
    XORing the whole thing would work IF it was just 1 value but
    we have two hmm

    The XOR of all the values except those two should be ZERO but checking
    pairs isn't linear

    XOR of all the items would be O(n) but would result in (output1 XOR output2)
    How can we separate the values

    Convert the thing into a set and linearly check if the XOR of a value with the above
    output is in the set? The set conversion would be O(n) with NONCONSTANT space then

    if xorVal bit == 0 then the original can be 1 ^ 1 or 0 ^ 0
    if xorVal bit == 1 then the original can be 1 ^ 0 or 0 ^ 1

    Let xorVal[0] be the first bit i.e. the 1's bit

    If we XOR all the values where xorVal[0] == 0 and XOR all the values where xorVal[0] == 1 
    then we should get the respective numbers right? cause otherwise they wouldn't XOR to 0

    Issue arises if both the output values are even or both are odd. We need to find a differentiating bit.

    Any bit in the xorVal will be a bit that's different between the two output values.

# CONSTANT Extra Space
# Must be O(n)

class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        xorVal = 0
        for i in nums :
            xorVal ^= i

        refVal = xorVal
        divBy = 1 
        while refVal % 2 == 0 :
            refVal = refVal // 2
            divBy *= 2
        refVal = (refVal % 2) * divBy

        val1, val2 = 0, 0        
        for i in nums :
            if refVal & i :
                val1 ^= i
            else :
                val2 ^= i
            
                
        return [val1, val2]
