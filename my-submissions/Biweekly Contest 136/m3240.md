#### Notes
- Make sure total number of 1's in grid divisible by 4

```
    Flip everything where the equiv in each of the 4
    quadrants where the 4 aren't equal

    (For now)
    - Ignore middle row if odd rows
    - Ignore middle col if odd cols

    (After)
    - Go back and check them afterwards to ensure
      that the values match each other
    - Make sure that the total flips is a multiple of 4
    - Middle middle will never be a 1 for a solved case so
      check that separately
