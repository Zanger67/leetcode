#### Initial thought process

- Use regex: `re.findall('[A-Z][a-z]\d+', formula)` to find all elements and their pairings
- Won't work cause of brackets
- Recursive call for the case of brackets


#### Later

- Could separate the formula into multiple layers of lists of lists
- Each time a bracket is found, let that element be a `tuple[list, int]` where the list is the inside case and the int is the multiplier
- Similar to the LinkedList question with "optional" nodes where it branches off, we can recursivly find this then recursively merge all the solutions

#### Final

- Recursively call the bracketed portions (find the indices using a counter and call)
- Calculate the multipliers and track counters
- Have to use if else cases to take care of the 2-letter and 1-letter elements
- Add the counters with a frequency multiplier
