``` 
    Concept idea:
    In each Node, we have x children
    In each TreeNode, we have 2 children

    We can do a pseudo-level order pass of the Node tree
    In each set of children, each child's right pointer points to the
    child immediately to the right, etc. etc.

    Each left pointer is reserved for the next level, i.e. one 
    node deeper into the tree.

    E.g.
                   ___1____       -->       ___1
                  /   |    \\     -->      /
                 3    2     4     -->     3  --  2  --- 4
               /  \\              -->   /
              5    6              -->  5 --- 6

    E.g. 2
                   ___1______     -->       ___1                -->          1
                  /   |      \\   -->      /                    -->         /
                 3    2       4   -->     3 --------- 2 ---- 4  -->      __3__
               /  \\   \\    /    -->   /            /      /   -->     /     \\
              5    6     9  8     -->  5 -- 6       9      8    -->    5       2
                                                                |-->    \\    / \\
                                                                |-->     6   9   4
                                                                |-->            /
                                                                +-->           8
```
