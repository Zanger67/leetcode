Beats 100% according to LC. I presume this is because most aren't optimizing it
with multinomials and are instead simulating every possible ordering.

Optimizations I've used:

-   Uses the frequencies of each character rather than the characters themselves
-   DFS's using the frequencies used instead of simulating the final strings
-   Uses multinomials to calculate how many arrangements of the selected characters instead of simulating them
