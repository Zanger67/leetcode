## Ideas
```
- have a max heap for the left side
- have a min heap for the right side
- have the median stay in the middle
- have a counter to keep track of how many of each term is present
  so we can pop as necessary to keep the numbers
  in line 
    - have one of the actual values and one of the intended values
```
