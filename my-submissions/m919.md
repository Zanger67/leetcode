$$\left \lfloor{\log_{2}(1)}\right \rfloor = lvl = 0$$

$$\left \lfloor{\log_{2}(2)}\right \rfloor = lvl = 1$$

$$\left \lfloor{\log_{2}(3)}\right \rfloor = lvl = 1$$

$$\left \lfloor{\log_{2}(4)}\right \rfloor = lvl = 2$$

$$\left \lfloor{\log_{2}(5)}\right \rfloor = lvl = 2$$

Their remainders go as follows:

$$Remainder(1) = 0 = 0b0$$

$$Remainder(2) = 0 = 0b0$$

$$Remainder(3) = 1 = 0b1$$

$$Remainder(4) = 0 = 0b00$$

$$Remainder(5) = 1 = 0b01$$

$$Remainder(6) = 2 = 0b10$$

$$Remainder(7) = 3 = 0b11$$


Ignoring the `root`, if we take the binary string and read it from 
left to right (not including the `0b` binary indicator), we can 
find the path to the proper index of the new node where `0` indicates
taking the left edge and `1` indicates taking the right edge. 

Remainders of $0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots$ indicate indices $0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots$.
