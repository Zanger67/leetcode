## V1 DFS Parallel Index Tracking

Indexes the indices of each character in `s` and creates a trie of
all potential subsequence words. Then, performs a DFS on the subsequence word trie while tracking the "last used index" of each character to see if each is valid.

Runtime: $O(s+w*v*s)$ where $s$ is the length of input string `s` and $w$ is the number of subsequence candidates in `words` and $v$ is the longest candidate in `words`.

## V2 Trie-Merging Recursion

Converts potential subsequence word targets into a trie then iterates through each character of `s`. At each character `c`, if it's in the trie, we remove it and merge the subtrie into the main trie root. That is, we merge `trie[c]` into the root `trie` and recursively merge the branches. We use `trie['.']` to track how many word "endings" we have. Since we're systematically eliminating letters and summing `trie['.']` we return `'.'` which is our counter.

Runtime: $O(s)$ where $s$ is the length of the input string `s`.
