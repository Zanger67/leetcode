### Notes
```
indicies r, c
0, 0 -> 0, c -> r, c -> r, 0 ->
1, 0 -> 1, c-1 -> r-1, c

Requires range for LEFT cause -1 in slice causes [] aka blank lists to be outputted even if valid.
In other words, this following line doesn't work due to python syntax reasons...
    output.extend(matrix[row_max][col_max: col_min - 1 : -1])
```
