For both, we simply compare chunk by chunk to check if the values are 
equal integer-wise. If we run out, we simply iterate through the 
remainder of each pointer and see if it's equal to zero, or if we 
need to return +/- 1. 

### Version 2:

**Runtime:** $O(n)$
**Space:** $O(1)$

Compared to V2, the process is very similar. In this case, it updates 
it current indices one at a time to avoid having to use $O(n)$ storage 
to preprocess and avoids having to compute integer conversions when it's 
unnecessary (i.e. if the answer is solvable early in the strings length).

### Version 1:

**Runtime:** $O(n)$
**Space:** $O(n)$

Splits both strings and parses them into integers first, extending the 
array itself by the missing zeros if necessary. This is still $O(1)$ but 
uses much more space than *Version 2* and also can result in unnecessary 
processing from when the answer is determined early on in the comparisons.
