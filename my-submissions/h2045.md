### Notes

#### Initial Thoughts
```
    Once we find the shortest path, the 2nd
    shortest will at most be that path + a back and forth

    That, or it'll be a single node more.
```

#### Later
```
    For the 2nd time reaching the end, it will only use 
    edges that have been traversed either once or twice since 
    all edges have the same weight.

    We can thus disregard any node visits that have been visited 
    more than twice already to prevent the first instance of a MLE.
```

#### Version 1: Dijkstra's
Instict since we're trying to find the shortest path was to use Dijkstra's and 
have a heap keep track of it all. This worked, but wasn't the most efficient with 
a runtime of upwards of 3000ms putting it at the back of the, though still ACed, pack.


#### Version 2: BFS
Since the edges aren't weighted, i.e. the time from one node to the next is always 
the same no matter which two nodes, Dijkstra's main advantage / purpose becomes redundant. 
The constant $\log{n}$ operations become more damaging than benefitial.


Instead, I tried adjusting it to BFS (a very minor adjustment --> just swapping 
the heapq operations for append with a deque) and it immediately joined the average 
AC runtime group on the graph (hovering around 1700ms).
