```
n <= x * ((x + 1) / 2)

n <= x * (x + 1) / 2
     (x^2 + x) / 2
2n <= x^2 + x
0 <= x^2 + x - 2n

x >= max of (-1 +- sqrt(1 + 8n)) / 2
x >= (-1 + sqrt(1 + 8n)) / 2
x >= -0.5 + sqrt((1 + 8n) / 4)
x >= -0.5 + sqrt((0.25 + 2n))

since we must cross,
x = ceil(-.5 + sqrt(.25 + 2n))
```

We'd have to use the ceiling function of this.

Interval is based on this number.


#### Version 1
An approximation that works and is simple though technically incorrect but not within the test cases.

#### Version 2
The actual formula that should be used.


#### Notes

This is identical to the `egg drop riddle`. A video on this was 
created by TED-ED which can be found [here](https://youtu.be/NGtt7GJ1uiM?si=9RrQ2WIshF9qsUCW).
