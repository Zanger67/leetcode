Notes

-   Convert edges into a two way mapping via a defaultdict
-   Track all visited nodes
-   Parse from a random starting node
-   Repeat from a random non visited node in case it's a disconnected graph

-   Groupings are partially based on cycles that exist
    -   E.g. in example 1, there's a cycle that's 1-2-6-4-1
    -   These maximize the grouping spread of those nodes in particular,
        limiting it to cycle_size / 2
    -   If a cycle is odd, it's impossible

Idea:

-   Is the answer just the longest independent line ignoring cycles
-   Returning -1 no answer if there's an odd cycle

Update: 49/55 test cases

-   My worry was true, cycles won't always end up being the longest independent line.
-   I need to calculate the lengths of each vistigial branch out from a cycle, and find which of the two ways
    around the cycle is smaller since the other branch will just "fold up"

Plan:

-   I have a feeling that brute forcing the farthest distance from each individual point is pbly
    within AC range for the constraints... As much as I want to deny it and not want to implement it
    since I've spent so long working on a more efficient Solution

... I hate that I was right...
