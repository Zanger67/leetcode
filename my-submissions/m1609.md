**Version 1:**

Stores each value in a defaultdict of stacks to compare a current 
value with the last in its current depth.

**Version 2:**

Uses a single stack which achieves a max `len()` of the height of the graph.
Since we're conducting a `DFS` traversal, we can compare the values according 
to the preorder traversal, and thus don't have to store any value except for 
the value immediately preceding it left to right on its current level.

We can also simply ignore this comparison if it's the first of a given depth.
