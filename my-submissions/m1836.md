This question is extremly similar to **Question 82** and I was able to reuse my code for that instance.


#### Update on July 7th, 2024
This question ended up being the `Weekly Premium` for this week, and as such I 
simply had to resubmit the code.

I also decided to redo the question but in Java to ensure that I was confident in it.

The `m1836 - orig.py` copy was my first attempt from way back, and the 
java `Weekly Premium` version is my new attempt.
