The only real limiting factor of the question is that the two values
cannot come from the same row. This presents us with 2 cases:

1. The max and min values in the whole matrix aren't from the same row therefore the output is the $max - min$.
2. They ARE from the same row, which means the answer will be one of the following (ensuring that the
   values don't come from the same row):
    1. Dif of the greatest and 2nd smallest
    2. Dif of the 2nd greatest and the smallest
    3. Dif of the 2nd greatest and the 2nd smallest

This means we simply have to track the 1st and 2nd largest and smallest values, as well as their indicies.
Then, we can make a constant time calculation to see which case of the above to follow.
