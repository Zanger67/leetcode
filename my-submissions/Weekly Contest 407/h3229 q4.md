####  Notes
```
    We can adjust the groups greedily taking the largest 
    group of similar signed values
    
    Have a feeling it's looking for a more mathematical
    approach though cause of the 
    
    Hard label --> potential speed issue?


    Realized this is a matter of identifying the crit points
    and divide and conquering from there
```


```
    I'm aware that this could be improved further by using 
    index references instead of passing nums[i:j] each time 
    since depending on the implementation, this could result 
    in Array copying. Though in the end, this is minimal and 
    if it is the case, I believe this would result in a worst 
    case O(n^2) space complexity due to it.
