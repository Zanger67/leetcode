#### Notes
```
    Greedy?
    
    leetcoder --> l ee tc o d e r --> ee, o, e

    aabbbb
    alice: a
    remaining: abbbb
    bob: cannot

    Idea
    If len(vowels) > 0
        Alice takes all but one

    If len(vowels) == odd :
        Alice takes all 
```

```
In version 2, which I did after the 
contest, I realized that I could simplify 
the process by just searching for the first match. 
This gets rid of the redundancy of continuously 
searching after one case has been found since Alice 
is guarenteed to win if there's at least one single 
vowel.
