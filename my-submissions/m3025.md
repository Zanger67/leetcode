Points sorted by $x$ then $-y$ since minimizing $x$ gives us the "leftmost" points and $-y$ gives us a secondary sorting based on the largest $y$ values. This lets us iterate and only check points right of a point in the list since any others are either left or above meaning the pairing has already been checked.

Since the points are sorted in such a manner, when comparing two points the only points that could be "between" are those between the two in the points[] array since values that are between $x$-wise will be sorted between them first and $y$-wise as a secondary case.
