#### Notes from during the contest
```
    - contains origin val
    - Cannot have 1x1 submatrix cause at least one X and equal XY

    Start on X spots and expand?
    Match X with nearest Y above, below, left, right?

    Weird prefix sum x2? Count by row and col, then also do a cumulative one to 
    get the instantaneous difference?

    Wait si this a area based prefix sum where you take a corner's full sum, add 
    the other corner, and remove the sides due to the overlap?

     add||   subtract

#### Notes from after
```
    I'm dumb lol. I interpretted the "contains grid[0][0]" as inside the box from (x1, y1) 
    to (x2, y2) inclusive, there must be at least one value equal to the value found at 
    grid[0][0]. 

    I realized after that it meant that each submatrix MUST START at (0, 0), simplifying 
    the question HEAVILY.
