Did the contest live and got through Q1 & Q2 very quickly. When I saw Q3 however, 
I got really confused so I decided to just skip it for now. Somehow, I was able to get 
Q4 then when I got back to Q3, I realized what the solution was and laid out the steps, 
but didn't have enough time to implement it. So yeah... good contest lol. First time 
getting 3 questions too funny enough lol.
