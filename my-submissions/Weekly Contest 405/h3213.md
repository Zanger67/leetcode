Did the contest live and got through Q1 & Q2 very quickly. When I saw Q3 however, 
I got really confused so I decided to just skip it for now. Somehow, I was able to get 
Q4 then when I got back to Q3, I realized what the solution was and laid out the steps, 
but didn't have enough time to implement it. So yeah... good contest lol. First time 
getting 3 questions too funny enough lol.


#### Version 1

Did a `DP` + `String Comparison` to get my solution. If this TLEed or MLEed, I would have 
changed to a `DP` + `Trie` solution to optimize the `word == target[i:i+len(word)]` portion. 
This, however, was unnecessary to pass the contest test cases, and so I moved onto 
another question as the contest was still active.

I do want to come back to this question and try the Aho–Corasick + DP solution.


#### Version 2

Tried adjusting for a `DP` + `Trie` solution and was successful. Overall time savings 
brought runtimes down from an average of `12300ms` down to `11700ms`, though only 
after additional tinkering. Next step, Aho-Corasick!
