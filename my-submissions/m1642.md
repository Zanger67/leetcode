Idea:

-   Parse through and create an array of length n containing the total UPWARDS movement
    since the beginning
-   Make a MAX heap containing Tuple[distance_upwards: int, index_of_movement]
-   Select the LADDERS number of max items by...
    -   Popping the taken values' farthest building case and supplementing it
        with the next MAX HEAP popped cases until the distance upwards
        distance matches the bricks number based on the prefix upward array

End idea:

-   Create a prefix sum array containing based on the POSITIVE differences in height
    -   Each index is the total upwards cost to get there
    -   This is because going down in height has no brick or ladder cost
-   Have a ladder list and a running count on how many bricks we save from using a ladder since each ladder can go up an infinite amount of height
-   Organize this ladder list based on the index in the prefix sum array
-   Using the highest index ladder we have as an "end point," pop it if the bricks we have cannot "fill the gaps" between the ladders and replace it with the next greatest brick-saving ladder that's of an index less than it.
-   Calculate how many past this ladder we can reach using just bricks.
