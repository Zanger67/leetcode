Notes

-   For a tree to be valid, $|E|=|V|-1$ must be true where $E$ is the edge set and $V$ is the vertex set
-   Check for cycle starting from a random node -- track visited nodes
    -   If any cycle is found, we return False
    -   If no cycle is found, we continue
-   Check if all nodes were visited
    -   If all nodes visited, we return True
    -   Else, we return False

In theory the all nodes visited check is all that we need as long as avoid infinite looping in cycles. However, it's more efficient if we break out early if a cycle is found.

The reason for the all nodes visited check after cycles is for graphs such as this:

```
     1          2
     |         / \
     3        4---5
```

This graph has 5 vertices and 4 edges which fulfills the first condition. It's possible we'll start our cycle check on vertex 1 wherein we won't have a cycle, but there's a cycle elsewhere.
