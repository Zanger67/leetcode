Plan:

-   Make edge set for each node
-   Choose a random start node for traversal (default to $1$ since nodes are labelled $1-n$ inclusive)
-   DFS from start
    -   If an end node is encountered, return None
    -   If a visited node is encountered, return the path from the first time visiting that node till the current
-   Return the last edge pair in `edges` where both $u$ and $v$ appear in the outputed cycle path

Reasoning:

-   If we have a connected graph with $n$ edges, then there must be a SINGLE cycle
-   Removing any of those edges is valid
-   Parameters dictate to give the last edge of the input edge list that fulfills the condition
