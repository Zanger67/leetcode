Since we only want a linkedlist of sums, if we have a non-zero value after we can just add it to our current node and delete it. What I decided to do was add the nodes to the zero node, and once another zero node was reached, we just move the current spot to that next pointer.

For instance:
```
0 -> 3 -> 1 -> 0 -> 4 -> 5 -> 2 -> 0
3      -> 1 -> 0 -> 4 -> 5 -> 2 -> 0
4           -> 0 -> 4 -> 5 -> 2 -> 0
4                -> 4 -> 5 -> 2 -> 0
4                -> 9      -> 2 -> 0
4                -> 11          -> 0
4                -> 11
4 -> 11

return
```

```
0 -> 1 -> 0 -> 3 -> 0 -> 2 -> 2 -> 0
1      -> 0 -> 3 -> 0 -> 2 -> 2 -> 0
1      -> 3      -> 0 -> 2 -> 2 -> 0
1      -> 3      -> 2      -> 2 -> 0
1      -> 3      -> 4           -> 0
1      -> 3      -> 4
1 -> 3 -> 4

return
```
