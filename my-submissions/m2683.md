0 = 0
1 = 1
2 = either 0 or 1

```
orig[0]     orig[1]     orig[2]     orig[3]     .......
   | \\_____   | \\_____   | \\_____   | \\_____   |
   |       \\  |       \\  |       \\  |       \\  |
der[0]       der[1]      der[2]      der[3]     .......


der[i] = orig[i - 1] ^ orig[i]
der[i] ^ orig[i - 1] = orig[i]

orig[i] = der[i] ^ orig[i - 1]
```

Idea 1:
I can see the possibility of there being multiple solutions
or paths in a sense. The main issue at hand is that we don't
know what the first index 0 value is in the original, thus
we can't predict how it'll cascade. I think, right now, that
the best option is to test both orig[0]=0 and orig[0] = 1

Idea 2:
The derived list can be interpreted as a mutation list that
accumulates the changes. We can see if the end result for index
0 is equal to the starting index we assigned maybe.

    Basically, use the derived as an accumulating XOR then see if it
    matches the original assumed value we assigned it (0 or 1) and
    check for both cases of 0 and 1.

Version 2/3 Idea:

```
orig_prev = v ^ orig_prev for v in derived
    ==>
    final_orig_prev = starter ^ v for v in derived
                    = derived[-1] ^ v for v in derived
```

Use accumulate()

In the end it simplifies to just whether the xor of all derived
values equals 0 or not, aka they all cancel each other out.
This could also be calculated in just seeing if the number of
ONES is odd.
