#### Version 1

```
    Notes
    Conditions
    - Collide = if occupy same spot
        - Same HP = both die
        - Else = lower dies other health -= 1

    - No more collisions: if all are going same direction 
                          or if none going towards each other
```


Note: this looks and feels very similar to 735 Asteroid Collisions (did it a today, the next day, and realized lol).
