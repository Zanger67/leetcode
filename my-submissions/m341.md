I choose to use a private inner class in this instance since my 
approach does an initial parsing of the data to remove empty `NestedIntegers` 
(e.g. the test case of `[[[]]]`). By using an PIC, 
I can call that to host the data when I make recursive creations of this 
iterator, saving that overhead time of $n$ which could in a 
worst case situation could result in a $O(n^2)$ overhead for initialization costs alone.

Since what we're iterating through is a `NestedInteger`, I thought it would 
be most suiting to create an Iterator that is, like the data, nested. So, 
in the program, I keep a tab of any current *nested iterators*, using them 
to their fullest to DFS through the data.
