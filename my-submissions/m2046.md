I decided for simplicity to do the *reversal* of the negative node order 
separately than splitting the negatives and positives.

In theory it would have been better to just return tuples of the new negative 
pointer and new positive pointer but I decided against it to try to aim 
for a better completion time this time.

**Steps that I took:**
1. Create dummy heads for the negative and positive chains
2. Iterate through the `LinkedList`, concatinating the current node to their respective dummy chain (negative or positive values)
3. Reverse the negative chain using a recursive helper
4. Attach the positive head to the end of the newly reversed negative chain
5. Return the head of the negative chain

In the end, this retains a $O(n)$ runtime and $O(1)$ space. It however does make multiple passes (1 pass of ALL, 2 passes of NEGATIVES).
