This to me is a straight forwards prefix sum array question where
the only difference is that you need to track all negative numbers
that you cross. This is since the edge case is when the most recent
negative value you come across at the point in which the prefix sum
goes negative is not enough to compensate, or if the previous few
sum to less of an abs difference than a single earlier value, thus
wasting moves.
