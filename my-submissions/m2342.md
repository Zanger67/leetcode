## V1

My original response which was within expectations runtime wise and efficiency wise.

## V2 and V3

V2 and V3 are identical, just with V3 being V2 expanded into a few lines for readability.
When doing V1 I thought it would be fun to make a oneliner version and it was a good way
for me to practice my itertools and function confidence.

To go line by line explaining:

```python
# max of the list containing:
#   -1 default
#   for each digit sum that appears in nums, what's the highest sum of those values
return max(
    [-1] + # default
    [
        sum(heapq.nlargest(2, [-inf] + list(group[1])))  # heapq nlargest = largest 2 values
                                                         # [-inf] accounts for if a digit sum is unique
                                                         # since nlargest(2, ...) will return 1 value if there's
                                                         # only 1 value

        for group in groupby(                            # itertools.groupby(...)

            sorted(nums, key=lambda y: sum(map(int, str(y)))),  # groupby doesn't always work if the
                                                                # values aren't sorted in the intended
                                                                # use case order (order of digit sum)

            key=lambda x: sum(map(int, str(x)))                 # key for both: sum (int value of each digit)
                                                                # I found this to be much more efficient since
                                                                # it's an iternal method which I presume uses
                                                                # C instead of python. For a oneliner this was
                                                                # the best choice at least and saved me a
                                                                # few test cases of runtime.
        )
    ]
)
```
