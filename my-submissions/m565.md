#### Version 1

Runtime: $O(2n)\rightarrow O(n)$

Space: $O(n)$

This is due to the initial hashmap conversion. Honestly isn't that efficient but still passes and is $O(n)$


#### Version 2

Runtime: $O(n)$

Space: $O(n)$

Also is $O(n)$ but doesn't have an initial pass to form a HashMap. Note that it's not necessary to add the original value (or any value of an index before the current for that matter) since they only appear once and only values to the right will be checked. Thus we won't encounter it again either way.
