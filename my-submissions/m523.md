    Notes
    If we have a leftPointer and rightPointer, they can move along
    like a sliding window, adding the new items and subtracting the
    leftmost items.

    This would be at most O(n^2) since C(n, 2) would be
    n!/(2!(n-2)!) aka n^2 (plus n cases where they are 
    the same value but eh still n^2)
