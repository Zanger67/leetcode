Logic:

Take arrays A and B. If B is of even length, then each element of A will
be XORed into the total of an even number of times, negating itself. This
applies to all values in the array. Thus we can skip it if B is even length.

The same applies vise versa.

Besides that, an odd number of times no matter how many will be just like
if there was only 1 XOR for that value since all others would negate it.
This is clear when you look at the definition of an odd integer: $x=2y+1$
where $x$ is your odd value and $y$ is an integer.
