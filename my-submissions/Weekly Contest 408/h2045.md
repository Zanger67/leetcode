### Notes

#### Initial Thoughts
```
    Once we find the shortest path, the 2nd
    shortest will at most be that path + a back and forth

    That, or it'll be a single node more.
```

#### Later
```
For the 2nd time reaching the end, it will only use 
edges that have been traversed either once or twice since 
all edges have the same weight.

We can thus disregard any node visits that have been visited 
more than twice already to prevent the first instance of a MLE.
