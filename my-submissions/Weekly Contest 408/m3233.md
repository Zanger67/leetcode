I realized that we're essentially trying to count the number of primes 
in the range of \[ceil(sqrt(l)), floor(sqrt(r))\] inclusive since 
the only values that will only have the factors 1 and a single other 
number are squares of primes. Otherwise, it will be two numbers multiplied 
plus the "1" case which would be 3 or more.

I initially made the mistake of thinking there was no potential way to continue 
opimizing my Python method so I tried Java out. This mislead me as it increased the 
test cases I was passing from ~400~600 up to the last ~20 test cases, so I thought 
this was the genuine reason. I realized afterwards however that I wasn't optimized 
for checking roots only up to $\sqrt{n}$ and was instead checking all potential 
prime factors of $n$.
