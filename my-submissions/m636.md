# Test case error

Reference link: https://github.com/LeetCode-Feedback/LeetCode-Feedback/issues/22693#event-14034172788

Found that one of the test cases was invalid and submitted it when I originally solved this question since it was preventing my code from working. 
This was verified by LeetCode in their feedback and now passes, so I've uploaded the code I originally had as the removal allows it to pass now.

## Work shown:

### Bug Description

Test case 121/123

`n=3`

`logs = ["1:start:0","0:start:2","1:start:3","2:start:4","2:end:4","0:end:6","1:end:7","1:end:8"]`)

has an expected output `[2, 6, 1]` which I believe to be invalid. Going through it by hand I believe it should be `[1, 7, 1]`

If I am mistaken then I do apologize for the confusion / inconvenience.

Two possible reasons:
1. `0:end:6` is invalid based on the question description since it's not the current active process
2. Assuming that we can cancel/end non-actives, the summed exclusive runtime of Process-0 at the time of cancellation is 1, meaning it cannot have an expected answer of 2. See below for the step-by-step.


 `["1:start:0","0:start:2","1:start:3","2:start:4","2:end:4","0:end:6","1:end:7","1:end:8"]`

With this, we can construct a table of `[0-8]` to fill.

| Time      | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   |  
| --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Process 0 |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     
| Process 1 |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     
| Process 2 |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     

`1:start:0` process 1 starts at `t=0`

| Time      | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   |    
| --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Process 0 |     |     |       |       |      |     |        |        |     |     
| Process 1 |  x   |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     
| Process 2 |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     

`0:start:2` Process 0 starts at time 2
Note that the start of a process is stated to be at the beginning of whatever `t` is set

| Time            | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   |   
| ---------      | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Process 0     |       |      |  x   |     |     |     |     |     |     |     
| Process 1     |   x  |  x   |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     
| Process 2     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     

`1:start:3` Process 1v2 (recursive process) starts at `t=3`

| Time              | 0   | 1   | 2     | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   |     
| ---------        | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Process 0       |       |      |  x   |     |     |     |     |     |     |     
| Process 1       |   x  |  x   |      |     |     |     |     |     |     |    
| Process 1v2    |      |      |      | x    |     |     |     |     |     |   
| Process 2       |      |      |      |     |     |     |     |     |     |     


`2:start:4` Process 2 starts at time 4, pausing process 1v2

| Time              | 0   | 1   | 2     | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   |   
| ---------        | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Process 0       |       |      |  x   |       |     |     |     |     |     |     
| Process 1       |   x  |  x   |      |       |     |     |     |     |     |     
| Process 1v2    |      |      |      | x     |     |     |     |     |     |     
| Process 2       |      |      |      |        | x     |     |     |     |     |   

`2:end:4` Process 2 immediately ends. Note, START starts at the beginning of the time and END ends at the end of the time slot, so process 2 gets +1 on it's output.
As a result, Process 1v2 continues

`0:end:6` occurs and halts that process but since it's not active, it has no effect.

| Time              | 0   | 1   | 2     | 3   | 4    | 5   | 6       | 7   | 8       |
| ---------        | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---    | --- | --- |
| Process 0       |       |      |  x   |       |      |      |          |     |         |
| Process 1       |   x  |  x   |      |       |       |      |         |     |         |
| Process 1v2    |      |      |      | x     |       | x   |  x      | x   |         |
| Process 2       |      |      |      |        | x     |     |         |     |        |

`1:end:7` Process ends at the *end* of 7, swapping back to process 1 (process 0 has already ended)

| Time              | 0   | 1   | 2     | 3   | 4    | 5   | 6       | 7   | 8       |
| ---------        | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---    | --- |--- |
| Process 0       |       |      |  x   |       |      |      |          |     |     |    
| Process 1       |   x  |  x   |      |       |       |      |         |     |  x   |  
| Process 1v2    |      |      |      | x     |       | x   |  x      | x   |     |   
| Process 2       |      |      |      |        | x     |     |         |     |     |    

`1:end:8` process ends at time 8 (at the end of it, adding 1 to the output)

Summing the values we get:
Process 0: 1
Process 1: 7 (3 from p1 and 4 from p1v2)
Process 2: 1
