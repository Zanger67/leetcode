## V1

Initial decently performing prefix sum + sliding window attempt.

## V2

Optimized window finding by using a max function

## V3

Optimized further (though at the expense of no longer being $O(1)$ space) by using `itertools.accumulate` to get the prefix sum.

**Note**: Built in functions are almost always more efficiently implemented due to them falling back on `C`.
