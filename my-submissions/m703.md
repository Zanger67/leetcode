***Disclaimer***: I don't think this question required a heap, given that it's classified as an Easy. The runtime allotment probably would have allowed plain insertions each time despite the $O(n)$ cost, but this would be the optimal way (using heaps).


**Version 1**
```
I used a dual heap to keep track of the values, using the bottom (smallest value) of the larger portion as the k-th value.
```

**Version 2**
```
While cleaning the code up, I generated this version wherein I realized that the requireemnts don't have any need for the smaller values, and since we're never "deleting" values at any point, we don't actually have to store those values and make those calculations. As such, I produced a version without those redundancies.
