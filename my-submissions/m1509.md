Since we have exactly 3 moves, we only have 4 cases to worry about.

First things first. If we have an array of length 4 or less, we can just set the values to be equal and have a difference of 0.

In most cases however, we will be comparing the 4 max values and 4 min values. By setting any extrema to a value of our choosing, we can set it to the average number, negating it all together. If we have $s1, s2, s3, s4, l4, l3, l2, l1,$ represent the smallest 4 and largest 4 values in the array, we know our result will be the min of: $min(l4-s1, l3-s2, l2-s3, l1-s4)$. 

The simplest approach is to sort and check these 4 values ($O(n\log{n})$).

Alternatively, we can do a single pass of the entire array to find the max 4 and min 4 values in linear time ($O(n)$). Even though in my case I used `sort()` to rearrange the values, since it's a single pass of in effect insertion sort on a array of max length 4, it remains linear.
