#### Logic:
- We should always take the greater value option if it's avalible.
- Cases where both are (e.g. `aba` or `bab`) we should still take
the greater option.
- We should parse just the greater value option first in case 
finding it and removing it causes another to appear. E.g. with `aaabbb` 
if `ab` is worth more than `ba` we remove `ab`, then `ab` again, etc.
- Reverse the stack each iteration / reverse the ordering we use since 
transfering the values of one stack to another reverses the order they 
will be popped in.


#### Version 1
```
Lot of redundancy here but it works. I tried chunking the input string into groups of just 
`abababaaababa` style strings, breaking them when there were non(a,b) characters 
since I thought I would need multiple passes so this was to remove that redundancy 
of checking non(a,b) strings. This was later realized to be unnecessary when 
I was optimizing my code
```

#### Version 2
```
Removed the redundancy of setting the new `findX` and `findY` values.
- We only have to check the larger one first then the smaller one
- Only 2 passes (one for each) are neccessary.
- The pass for the larger one is guarenteed to remove all instances leaving
  a string of (...aaaabbbbb...) or (...bbbbaaaa...)

Previously, my code was checking for both and resetting the search if 
one was found, which was redundant since it was making extra passes 
when not neccessary.
```


#### Version 3
```
I split my code away from chunking since that became unnecessary 
since I was only doing 2 passes and finding the chunks would be 
a pass on its own making the benefit nonexistant. This removed a 
number of lines too and removed the need for extra variables such 
as the check for reversing the stack for instance.
