`goneLeft()` and `goneRight()` exist to prevent redundant node checks. 

Take for instance:

```
    a           
     \          Checking b-d-e-g (right-left-right-left)
      b         would occur first.
     / \        
    c   d       Once we reach here at (d) however, checking
       / \      d-e-g would be redundant since this direction
      e   f     from this node has already been included in
       \        a the "superset" case, which is guarenteed
        g       to be longer
         \      
          h     
```
