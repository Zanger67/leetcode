#### Version 1: Semi Brute Force

This version simply iterated with a set to see if the case was found before. If it was, change the longest recorded case.

Optimizations:
- `j` from `i + 1 + longest` to end $\rightarrow$ since shorter strings are redundant
- substr set --> to avoid having to double the iterations

This ends up being $O(n^3)$ due to the $O(n^2)$ looping and $O(n)$ substring pulling / hash making.
