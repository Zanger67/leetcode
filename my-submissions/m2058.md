To find the critical points, we can simply iterate through each to see see if that node is a critical point, storing its index if it is in fact a critcal point.

We also know that we can't have a crit pt if the array length is less than 3 or if we don't have at least 2 points.


***Notes on my Versions***
```
Versions 1 and 2 make use of lists to keep track of the critical points, 
making a second pass through them afterwards to determine the output.

This use of a list/arraylist could be removed however. Notably, in my C++ 
version (Version 3), I decided to make use of additional variables instead
of a vector, saving heavily on space and partially in runtime as well.

This is permitted due to us only needing to keep track of the following:
1. the smallest gap between consecutive crit points
2. the largest gap, aka the difference of indices betweeen
   the first and last critical point.
