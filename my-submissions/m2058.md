To find the critical points, we can simply iterate through each to see see if that node is a critical point, storing its index if it is in fact a critcal point.

We also know that we can't have a crit pt if the array length is less than 3 or if we don't have at least 2 points.


***Notes on my Versions***
```
Versions 1 and 2 make use of lists to keep track of the critical points, making a second pass through them afterwards. This could be removed to save memory and runtime by making use of additional O(1) integers which you can see in my C++ solution.
