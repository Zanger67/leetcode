Notes

The summation for example 1 is:
39
= 12+9+10+8
= 3*(1+4+3+5)
= 3*(sum of unconvered values)


V1:
    In this case, looking at the 2nd example for reference, the value 3 seems
    to originate from the number of connected cells (4 cells are connected so
    we multiply by 3). In the case of the 2nd example, it's mult by 1 since
    one island is 2 cells and 0 for the other since it's an island of 1.


    This ends up being an largest island question where we sum the values instead

V2:
    I realized that I misunderstood the prompt. In this case, it's not multiplying
    by neighboring islands but rather NON neighboring islands. Thus, the equation
    ends up being something along the lines of...

    output = sum(
        (total sum of all islands - current island) * size of island
        for island in islands
        )
```
