### The chicken mcnugget theorem hehe

This boils down to an induction proof for the postage problem.
After a certain point, you can generate any value since you 
can fill in all the values between two values somehow, then 
just add the smaller denomination from a starting point.

This is solvable via the chicken mcnugget theorem
