#### Notes

```
if you have X _ _ _ X where X=sick and _=not sick, how many ways?

We can count the gaps then multiple the number of ways each gap can do it
1 person --> 1
2 ppl --> 2
3 ppl --> 4
X__ XX_ XXX
X__ X_X XXX
__X _XX XXX
__X X_X XXX

X____ XX__ XXX_ XXXX
X____ XX__ XX_X XXXX
X____ XX__ X_XX XXXX
X____ X__X X_XX XXXX
X____ X__X XX_X XXXX
...

2*2*2*1?

Cause we have left and right as a choice each time till the last where they merge

Let n=size of gap

# Ways = 2^(n-1)


The leftmost group and rightmost group only have 1 way since they're
against a wall figuratively speaking

Edge cases (literally):
X _ _ _ _   only 1 way
_ X _       2 ways
_ _ X       1 way
_ X _ _     3 ways

_ _ X _ _   6 ways
Right-Left side is 4 choose 2?

m+n choose m? it's a binary string method

This also becomes a multimodal where we have all the groups and we 
have to figure out how to order our choices


FINAL FORMULA: 
Product of:
2^(g - 1) for each group surrounded by 2 sick individuals
(L + R) choose (L) where L and R are the number of not sick people on the edges
(n!)(a!b!c!...z!) where n=the total number of not sick indivudals 
                    and a,b,c...= the size of each not sick group
