#### Version 5 (Optimal)
```
The final optimization that had to be made was not updating the max frequency
downwards at any given moment. Since we're only looking at the context of our
window, the maximal window will require the most repeated characters, since all
others must be changed to match them. Therefore, if the max frequency goes down,
we know for certain that that window won't be valid, so we should just 
shift over an index for both the left and right pointers.

This brought the runtime down to around 75ms, in line with all the 
submitted optimal solutions and perfectly within the bell curve.
```

#### Version 4
```
Here, I changed out the way I'd calculate the total number of 
non-max frequency characters to a mathematical approach. I had overlooked 
it in my haste initially, but the number of characters that would have to be 
changed was simply the length - the frequency of the most frequent character.

The effect was essentially unnoticable however based on how LeetCode 
runs their tests and the time remained similar to Version 3.
```

#### Version 3
```
Compared to Version 2, the improvment here was minimal. I adjusted the 
tracking variable for the longest window to start at length k, since we'd 
at minimum find a case where every letter is unique, thus giving us a result
of k+1 length.

This reduced the time down to around 180ms and the 11% region.
```

#### Version 2
```
In this version, I made the slight adjustment to only check windows
that were larger than the previous window size. This was a step
in the right direction, and was based on a similar idea as the optimal 
solution as it turns out.

This small adjustment resulted in a drop to 320ms per run.
```

#### Version 1
```
This was my first attempt at the question which passed without 
any TLE issues first try in under 9 minutes. However, it was on 
the brink of a TLE. On average, the runtime was measured at the 
bottom 5%, taking 520ms approx. The idea was correct, 
but it did need some modifications.
