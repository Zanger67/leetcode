We can generate MSTs using a simplified form of Prims where we prioritize 
Type-3 edges (edges that both Alice and Bob can traverse) over Type-1 and 
Type-2 edges. As long as we greedily take the shared branches first, making 
sure to not cause cycles, then we'll generate a MST that uses the most 
possible shared edges. Thus any remaining unused edges from the Type-1 
and Type-2 traversals (Alice's and Bob's traversals) will be extra.

    Instinct/Notes
    In essence double prims where yuo always select the type 3s if present
    and not redundant?
