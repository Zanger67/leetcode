#### Notes
````
    Observing the samples, the distance of each "side" travelled follows
    the order of 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, ... etc.

    I.e. we repeat a side length then increment.

    This makes sense as it follows whether we're traversing
    the height or width of the current "square."


    It is possible to further optimize this by "skipping" the
    out-of-bounds portions but this optimization isn't necessary for
    this medium question.
