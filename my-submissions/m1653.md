#### Version 1
First attempt using it was with a deque for easy 
reading and iteration through. Also made use of a counter 
to get an easy and quick count of the occurances.

#### Version 2
Removed the use of a deque since two-pointer would be much 
more efficient. This reduced the O(n) creation time of the deque 
and removes the overhead needed for pop operations. 

Also swapped the `Counter()` for a traditional counting method 
since the fact that we only have `a`s and `b`s means we can 
just count one and we know the other. This also removes the 
overhead of a dictionary/counter class.

These two improvements improved our runtime by about 2.5x.
